#### Description(s)

<!-- scope: microscope -->
<!-- info: Provide a description of the methods used to
validate the dataset.

Use additional notes to capture any other
relevant information or considerations.

(Usage Note: Duplicate and complete the
following for each validator type.) -->

**Range and Constraint Validation**

**Method:**

-   Verified that Season values fall within 1985–2025.

-   Checked that fields such as DayNum, WScore, and LScore contain no negative values.

**Platforms, tools, or libraries:**

-   Python
-   Pandas

**Validation Results:**

✅ All Season values are valid.

✅ All numeric game values are non-negative.

**Additional Notes:** This validation step ensures that no out-of-bounds or corrupted data points interfere with model training.

**Code / Cross-reference Validation**

**Method:**

-   Compared team IDs in result and seed datasets to the official team lists using set logic in Python.

-   Checked columns: WTeamID, LTeamID, TeamID.

**Platforms, tools, or libraries:**

-   Python
-   Pandas

**Validation Results:**

✅ All team IDs in both men's and women's datasets match the official team files. No unmatched or orphaned IDs were found.

**Additional Notes:** This validation ensures referential integrity across game result data and team metadata.

**Consistency Validation**

**Method:**

-   Printed unique values of region fields (RegionW, RegionX, RegionY, RegionZ) in MSeasons and WSeasons.

-   Verified consistency with historical naming patterns.

**Platforms, tools, or libraries:**

-   Python
-   Pandas

**Validation Results:**

-   Men's Regions:

    -   RegionW: ['East', 'Atlanta', 'Albuquerque', 'NA1']

    -   RegionX: ['West', 'Midwest', 'Southeast', 'South', 'Phoenix', 'Chicago', 'Oakland', 'NA2']

    -   RegionY: ['Midwest', 'Southeast', 'South', 'EastRutherford', 'Austin', 'Minneapolis', 'NA3']

    -   RegionZ: ['Southeast', 'West', 'South', 'StLouis', 'Syracuse', 'WashingtonDC', 'Southwest', 'NA4']

-   Women's Regions:
    (Includes broader set reflecting more diversity in site locations)

        -  e.g., ['Chattanooga', 'DesMoines', 'Alamo', 'Seattle4', 'RiverWalk', etc.]

**Additional Notes:** The presence of NA1 to NA4 suggests placeholders, which may require downstream handling depending on modeling use cases.

## Terms of Art

### Concepts and Definitions referenced in this Data Card

#### Term of Art: Brier Score

**Definition**: A metric used to measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. It calculates the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes.  
**Source**: [Wikipedia - Brier Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score)  
**Interpretation**: In this competition, the Brier Score evaluates how close your predicted win probabilities are to the actual game results. A lower Brier Score indicates better performance.

---

#### Term of Art: Seed

**Definition**: A number assigned to each team in a tournament to represent its ranking or expected performance. Lower seed numbers indicate higher-ranked teams.  
**Source**: [NCAA - March Madness Seeding](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/bracketiq/2025-01-22/what-march-madness-ncaa-tournament-explained)  
**Interpretation**: Seeds are used as a predictive feature in our model, often in the form of "Seed Difference" between two teams in a matchup.

---

#### Term of Art: Feature Engineering

**Definition**: The process of using domain knowledge to create additional input variables (features) that make machine learning algorithms work better.  
**Source**: [Wikipedia - Feature Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering)  
**Interpretation**: We created features such as win/loss ratios, scoring margin, and seed differences to improve model accuracy.

---

#### Term of Art: Matchup

**Definition**: A potential game between two teams in the NCAA tournament bracket.  
**Source**: Common usage in sports analytics.  
**Interpretation**: In this competition, we generate predictions for every possible matchup, whether or not the game actually occurs.

### Team Performance

Games Played: On average, teams play around 28-30 games a season depending how well they do. The top teams by games played, such as Duke, Kansas, and North Carolina, are all consistently strong performers. However their repeated represenation can lead to bias with schools with less extensive data or shorter season.

Win Percentage: The average win percentage across all teams is 48.03%, with top teams (e.g., Duke and Kansas) reaching win percentages over 79% a season, indicating a strong historical performance. Teams with fewer games played tend to show a wider variance in performance. Which we will also need to find a way to account for in our model. (These are the typical underdogs that could lead to big upsets)

Tournament Participation: The mean tournament participation rate is approximately 1.06, suggesting that while some teams regularly make the tournament, others may only participate sporadically. This is also seen in overall games played, the best teams have the highest overall games played since they consistently go to the finals. Seperating themselves from the pack. Teams less involved in the tournaments have little to no uniformity.

### Conference Trends

Games Played: Conferences like the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Atlantic 10 Conference have the highest number of games played, suggesting strong and competitive leagues. In contrast, conferences like the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) have lower game totals, reflecting less competition.

Win Percentage: Win percentages across conferences show a lot of variability, with the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) performing at a high level (60.80%) and the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) performing at a much lower level (39.02%). This highlights the difference in strength between conferences.

Tournament Performance: The average tournament win percentage across conferences is 34.55%, with some conferences like the ACC having higher success rates in tournament play, and others facing more challenges.
